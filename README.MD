Hereâ€™s a simple `README.md` file with proper Markdown syntax:

````markdown
# Project Setup

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install flask google-generativeai playsound
````

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Ensure you have an active audio output device connected and enabled.

```

Do you want me to also make this README include **a section for API key setup** in case your project needs one? That would make it more complete.
```
